What is Reactive Programming?

Reactive programming is a design approach that uses asynchronous programming logic to handle real-time adjustments. So the core of reactive programming is a data stream that we can observe and react to, even apply back pressure as well. In plain terms, reactive programming is about non-blocking applications that are asynchronous and event-driven and require a small number of threads to scale.
A key aspect is to understand the concept of backpressure, which is a mechanism just to ensure producers donâ€™t overburden consumers
Why is a need for Reactive Programming?

Several modern applications today require the ability to handle multiple concurrent or simultaneous requests. Therefore, traditional methods are inadequate to handle these operations.

To move forward, we need to embrace the principle that software should be developed by utilizing hardware efficiently, which has been a part of the software engineering community for a long time.

Reactive programming on the server side allows web applications or server-side applications to perform and scale more efficiently. By utilizing this structure, server-side applications can handle multiple requests asynchronously, improving performance, increasing scalability, and handling high-user traffic.
The Publisher creates an event or message for every result obtained, and it can send the Subscriber (n) numbers of values by calling onNext, but the important thing to keep in mind here is that it can also signal an error by calling onError, which can terminate the sequence, while if onComplete is called, the sequence is terminated by default.

In Reactor, Flux, and Mono, there are two primary primitive publishers.

Flux: A Flux Publisher in Reactor publishes data or event and can produce from 0 to N values asynchronously.

Mono: There is only one value that a Mono publisher can produce, or perhaps none at all.

Reactive framework support in Spring with Spring Web Flux
Spring Web Flux is a reactive programming model introduced by Pivotal in Spring 5.
It provides an asynchronous, non-blocking, and event-driven architecture for building web applications that are resilient and responsive.
It enables developers to build applications that can handle high loads of traffic without compromising on performance.
The framework is based on the Reactive Streams specification and provides support for both client-side and server-side development.
With the help of Spring Web Flux, developers can create applications that are more efficient and scalable than traditional ones.

To start with using Web Flux with spring boot we will require below dependency

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-webflux</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.5</version>
</dependency>
Once you have added the dependency, you can start building reactive applications using the annotations provided by Spring WebFlux.

Conclusion:
Reactive programming is a powerful programming paradigm that can help you build responsive, resilient, and scalable applications. By using Reactive programming with Spring Boot, you can take advantage of the many benefits it offers while still leveraging the power and flexibility of Spring Boot. So go ahead and give it a try!
